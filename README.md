# Network-Scanner

A network scanner script for Linux that sends and receives ARP packages to display the IP and MAC 
addresses of clients in a given subnet. Compatible with python 2 and python 3. 

## Usage

To run the script, type "python network_scanner.py -t TARGET_IP_ADDRESS" to the shell,
where TARGET_IP_ADDRESS is the ip address or ip range that you want to scan. Use the 
"-help" option for details.

## Credits

This code mainly depends on the work of Zaid Sabih from zSecurity.
Enhancements and other customizations are made by me.
